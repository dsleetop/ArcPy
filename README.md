ArcPy
=====

Experimental project to produce PDFs from multiple ArcGIS mxd resident on ArcGIS Server 10. Additionally, data from feature attribute tables was output to and formatted in MS Excel on the fly within the Python script.

6 different reports are available within the Province of Ontario and samples are included in the repository.

The target geographic reference and other properties such as map scale and buffer distances were hardcoded for testing purposes.

The star of the show is the Python script employing ESRI ArcPy classes. This was my first Python script of any description and my first experience working with anything COM related.

I figure go big or go home...
